And since I've been enjoying ES6, I've gotten into the habit of destructing everything. If I can make my code look organized, I feel proud. So when I see `this.props.aCoolProp`\u00a0sprawled all over my screen I cry a little inside. Why? Because to me, assigning properties of an object to variables of the same name is incredibly neat. Destructuring encourages me to think about my naming patterns and allows me to clearly see what I am doing when reading through\u00a0my code.\n\nOr so I thought.\n\n## The issue of readability and data origin\n\nI noticed a pattern with [my colleague Fred](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric-colin-163b7251/), specifically within his code, he seemed to avoid destructing like the plague! Naturally this was driving me crazy. You see, Fred is a very talented guy, surely I thought, he must know how to destructure! So I asked him about it. And boy did he have an opinion on it. In Fred's opinion, destructing makes things _**more**_ difficult to read! To him, seeing `this.props` and `this.state` makes it easier to identify where the variable originates from.\n\nAnd that made sense. If you have a prefix, it would make it easier to know whether this was a property from a parent or a local variable. At the cost of lengthier statements.\n\nSo that was fine, but my problem still persisted. How can you prefix everything. If you have fifty variables, you would have this.props written fifty times. Which negates the benefit. So where do you draw the line?\n\nWhen should you use destructuring, and when should you not. Or when should we rename a property?\n\n## What we found useful\n\nWe found that for smaller functions, we prefer to destructure but for long functions, i.e. exceeding 20 or so lines, we found it useful not to destructure all the time as we would lose track of the source of the variables.\n\nHowever, we could not come up with a rule we could follow all the time and we still somehow felt dissatisfied with the available native methods. We needed a tool to\u00a0safely extract JavaScript\u00a0objects in an easy to read manner. To reconcile both sides, Fred decided to build [a neat library to destructure intelligently.](https://www.npmjs.com/package/revampjs) The library lets you\u00a0group extracted variables within a new object, and defaults to `undefined` for any variable not found in the source object, even when the value is nested.\n\nAnd did I mention it works with immutable data?\n\nIt works like this:\n\n```javascript\nconst sourceObject = {\n  a: 42,\n  b: \"hello\",\n  c: \"world\",\n  d: \"!\",\n  e: { f: \"nested\u00a0value\" }\n};\n```\n\nWe've used Fred's tool in a few projects and it's actually fairly practical.
