I know, I know, _classic_ React guy. Trying to shove everything into my JavaScript. I need to learn how to stay in my lane, I know. Look, that's not what this is about.\n\nThis is about Semantics.\n\nI noticed something new while working on my project. You see, I was looking through my code using Google Chrome's inspector tool, like I always do, trying to pin point why my animation wasn't working. You know, normal dev stuff. And that's when I noticed it.\n\n`<div class=\"TextContainer__TextContainer-evEmKn hpLTip\"/>`\n\nNow, I had not been working with the latest version of the aforementioned library for some time, which is usual, I don't make it a pattern to update packages 9 months into a project. But now that I started some new projects, I am hopping on the `latest` train left and right.\n\nSo when I saw the semantic class naming going on here I was pretty excited.\n\nYou see, I am a bit fanatic about semantic naming. Functions, classes, parameters, you name it. _I name it_, diligently.\n\nAnd that got me thinking, what does it mean to semantically create class names? What should be the standard. I love the approach taken by Styled Components. But I also adamantly support Foundation by Zurb. Foundation uses a logical naming scheme based on what the element will function as, this library is assigning names based on my components, which I name _semantically, based on what they are._ These are slightly different concepts.\n\nSo then, what makes names semantic anyway.\n\n> \"Semantic classes don\u2019t convey their styles\"\n>\n> -\u00a0[MaintainableCSS](https://maintainablecss.com/chapters/semantics/)\n\nClass names should be easily understood. For instance, when I read JavaScript, I **cannot** stand seeing `const mapDataFunction = data => data.map( subdata => <div>{subdata}</div> )`.\n\nIt's madness.\n\nRather, I want to know, _what_ the data is, and _what_ it is being mapped to!\n\nSo today I learned, the what, is very important in semantics.\n\nKeep it up,\u00a0[`styled-components`](https://www.styled-components.com/)."}
