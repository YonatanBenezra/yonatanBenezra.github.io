# Are Artificial Neural Networks a modern invention?

Well, it depends on your definition of modern – I would say _not quite!_

As brought out by Sebastian Schuchmann in this excellent YouTube video, while ‘the success of Neural Networks has sparked the AI revolution in the last 10 years… the basic idea of Neural Networks has been around since the late 1950s’!

I’m sure this will surprise quite a few people outside of the AI field (but hopefully not those in it!)

I encourage you to check out Sebastian’s video; ‘The Origins of Neural Networks’, embedded below.
