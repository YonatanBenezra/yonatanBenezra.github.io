# State of the art AI in 2019

It is always enjoyable for me to discuss the state of AI with my friends and colleagues with little or no knowledge of the field, sometimes, the things professionals in the field find interesting or important can differ so greatly from what the average person finds “cool”. Now, this of course means that, as in all fields, the most useful advancements in AI will generally go unappreciated by most people.

For instance, when the topic is raised, often the focus falls on the end result; “did you hear about that new AI that can do…”

While this isn’t all bad (it’s awesome to hear that people are excited for AI after all), I think that some of the other advancements in the field deserve a little more attention (I’m looking at you, Transfer Learning.)

So I wanted to share this interesting video offering a top-level overview of Artificial (General) Intelligence as of 2019\. The video aims to highlight what is currently considered “state of the art”, as well as the frontiers we are currently breaching (such as Explainable AI, which is currently very interesting to Microsoft and some other big players). The video also discusses what advancements might be made in the near (or far) future.

It gave me some new talking points that I will use to draw attention to advancements that are important to me, and I hope it can do the same for you.
